Comandi per usare lex e yacc:

   lex dx3.l
   yacc -d dx3.y (or bison -dy dx3.y)
   gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c -o dx3
   ./dx3 input.dx3
   
Dove input.dx3 Ã¨ il codice


What now?
-keyword meaning "undefined" needed
-built-in math entities (sets, sequences)
-imports? includes? when sparring, dx3 should load the set of
 core classes (#included as standard).But a developer should be
 able to include its own dx3 files, and this is possible using built in yybuffer functions.
-makefile
