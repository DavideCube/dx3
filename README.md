:coffee: ginseng Programming Language

This Lex and Yacc definitions are part of a Ginseng compiler. Ginseng is a tiny custom programming language developed by us as part of a compiler programming project for the Free University of Bolzano.
The .l and .y files hold the source code for generating a lexer and a parser for our compiler.
