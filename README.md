:coffee: ginseng Programming Language

Ginseng is a small, strongly typed programming language designed by us and oriented to arithmetical calculations. It provides the developer with a collection of embedded operators and data structures representing abstractions of mathematical objects, such as unbounded sets and sequences (arrays).
The compiler we developed for this language is called ginseng1.1.0, implemented with Lex and Yacc.
